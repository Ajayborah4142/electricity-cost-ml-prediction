## 🚀 Project Overview

Accurate electricity consumption prediction helps governments, power
companies, and consumers plan better for future demands. This project
builds ML models that predict electricity usage based on various
features such as:

-   Date & Time
-   Temperature
-   Humidity
-   Seasonal effects
-   Historical consumption

The notebook includes:

✔ Data loading & cleaning\
✔ EDA with visualizations\
✔ Feature engineering\
✔ Model building\
✔ Model comparison\
✔ Final predictions
